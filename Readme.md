# Rate Limiter

I have made a simple rate limiter using core php,JS,JQUERY and bootstrap. The main logic is written at the backend.

## Stack Used

    PHP (core)
    JS + Jquery
    Bootstrap

## Installation

    Just goto the server.php file to input database connection details. And place the repo in www or htdocs of your apache installation.

## Conclusion

    No pre-made libraries or code were used in the development of this script. Because I wanted to showcase my basic logics.
    Made with <3.
